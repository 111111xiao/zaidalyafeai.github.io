<p> The main purpose of this project is to create a web applications for quick image to image translation.  The implementation is based
    on the paper. The user can draw a sketch or a semantic map to the left and the application will render it to a real image on the right canvas. 
    The model was trained using Tensorflow and converted to a web application using Tensorflow.js.

<p> The main purpose of this project is to design an application to make face segmentation directly from the webcam. The basic model is a U-Net 
    model extracted from pix2pix trained on this faces dataset. To make sure that the model runs in real time the model was trained with less
    parameters and more augmented dataset.

<p> In this project the model takes live feed from the webcam and tries to reconstuct the original image. It is based on two models. The first 
    model is based on the face semgnetation project; so basically it creates face segmentation. The second model was trained on a celebrity dataset
    where the input is a segmented face and the output is a celebirty face.
